        if 'original_match' in data:
            del data['original_match']  # Remove before CSV processing
    return gym_data, processed_patterns
```

#### Add Time Validation:
```python
# Add time validation in extract_gym_data method
def validate_time(hour, minute):
    return 0 <= hour <= 23 and 0 <= minute <= 59

# In processing loop:
if not validate_time(hour, minute):
    self.logger.warning(f"Invalid time {hour:02d}:{minute:02d} - skipping")
